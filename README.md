# 📖 Next Word Prediction with LSTM-RNN

This is a web application for predicting the next word in a sequence using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Recurrent Neural Network. The app is built with Streamlit and allows users to input a sequence of words to get the predicted next word.

## 🚀 Live Demo

You can access the live demo of the app [here](https://next-word-prediction-fdkxuqugmhru2fy35l6jpd.streamlit.app/).

## ✨ Features

- 🖥️ User-friendly web interface built with Streamlit
- 🔮 Utilizes an LSTM RNN model for next word prediction
- 📝 Predicts the next word based on the input sequence of words

## 🔍 Model and Tokenizer

- The LSTM model is trained to predict the next word in a sequence of words. Make sure the `next_word_lstm.h5` and `tokenizer.pickle` files are in the project directory.
- If you need to retrain the model, you can use your own dataset and save the model and tokenizer files in the appropriate format.
